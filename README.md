# Logbook

## Logbook for FYP First Semester

###### Sep 8-15, 2017
Organised the first meeting with Prof. Lau. I had presented my idea about how to apply blockchain into cloud storage system. In this week I focused on finding example and research of blockchain cloud storages.  
  
###### Sep 18-22, 2017
In this week, I reviewed the possibility of using blockchain in voting and commenting system, adjusted the topic and work on the research about blockchain and blockchain applications on reality. I had tried to find out some daily problem could use blockchain as a solution.  
  
###### Sep 25-29, 2017
In this week, I created a project on GitHub to save all the progress of the project. In addition to start working on writing the introduction of the blockchain application. I had also created the logbook, read the paper “Cryptographic Counters and Applications to Electronic Voting” (by Jonathan Katz, Steven Myers and Rafail Ostrovsky), try get more information about the electronic voting system in reality. I had contacted Prof. Lau through email and discussed about the architecture of the system.  
  
###### Oct 02-06, 2017
In this week I mainly focused on writing the description of the application, added different part namely the requirements, assumptions and expected outcome in the description on GitHub. In addition I kept working on research about different method of information exchange over the untrusted network.  
  
###### Oct 09-13, 2017
In this week I focused on writing the proposal, identify the problem of existing voting system. In addition, I started to think about the methodology of blockchain voting system. I had also contacted Prof. Lau through email and reported the progress of my work. Prof. Lau gave some suggestion and I attempted to modify my work.
  
###### Oct 16-20, 2017
I had found different research on the method of blind signatures. I started writing the report on comparing different signatures, mainly focused on RSA, DSA signature, Cryptographic Counters and Mix-nets. In addition, I had created some graphics to illustrate the expected outcome of the system.
  
###### Oct 23-27, 2017
I started testing on different blockchain cloud based system such as the Ethereum Test Network, Azure Blockchain-as-a-Service. The Azure Blockchain could create a blockchain VM for running the service. I focused on creating a VM for testing the Azure solution: Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network.
  
###### Oct 30-Nov 3, 2017
I started to build the application with ionic and react-native. After tried both tools, I decided to use the react- native for building the application frontend.
  
###### Nov 06-10, 2017
In this week, I worked on designing the architecture of the application, studied the blind signature and finish writing the description of blind signature and prepared some graphics to illustrate the concept.
  
###### Nov 13-17, 2017
In this week, I was working on designing the blockchain part of the application. Configuring the blockchain service on the Azure.
  
###### Nov 20-24, 2017
In this week, I was writing the report and finish the result, discussion and the future plan. Finalise the result and keep on making info graphics.
  
###### Nov 27-Dec 01, 2017
Finalise the Final Report, added the reference and completed different sections.
  


## Logbook for FYP Second Semester

###### Jan 08-12, 2018
This week I was start writing the draft report, writing the introduction and applicaion flow. The application flow will be implemented.
  
###### Jan 15-19, 2018
This week I was configuring the React Native for building a moblie app for the blockchain voting system. Start to build the frontend, which is the voting part of the system.
  
###### Jan 15-19, 2018
This week I was doing some research on the private Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract, namely the go-ethereum and the Truffle would be good for building a private blockcahin service.
  
###### Jan 29-Feb 02, 2018
This week I was doing research on the go-Ethereum and dapp, for building the dapp the project could use the Truffle. I was writing the introduction of the Truffle and Ethereum.
  
###### Feb 05-09, 2018
This week I was studying the example of Truffle, trying to use the Truffle to build a dapp.
  
###### Feb 12-16, 2018
Chinese New Year
  
###### Feb 19-23, 2018
This week I was focusing on building the Truffle application. Also try to figure out the possibility of running the Truffle application on the Azure cloud.
  
###### Feb 26-Mar 02, 2018
I was developing the application with Truffle and Ganache, it could use the web for voting. It is using javascript and relaying on the Ethereum network. However, it is using the private network instand of the Ethereum testnet.
  
###### Mar 05-09, 2018
I was still working on the application part, it created a web GUI interface for interacting the service and the blockchain. The application contained a index.html and index.js.
  
###### Mar 12-16, 2018
I was working on the applcation, creating different questions for the demo of a course evluation. I was also studying on the method of deploying the application to the Azure and the [Guidelines on Course and Teaching Evaluation](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/clear/qm/A7-3.pdf) of CUHK.

###### Mar 19-23, 2018
I was working on the coding part, keep on building the application. Try to create a sample course evaluation. I was studying how the Truffle working on Azure.

###### Mar 26-30, 2018
I was started to write the report and review the previous documents. I was also keep on coding. I was working on the javascript and html code.

###### Apr 02-06, 2018
I was working on the project report and keep on creating the content on the application. I was editing the voting.sol for understanding the smart contract of Ethereum.

###### Apr 09-13, 2018
I was writing the vote.sol of the project, adding more questions. In addition I was working on the index.html for providing interface let user easier to use.

###### Apr 16-20, 2018
I was start writing the report of descripting the project. Additionally adding more functions on the vote.sol for better performance.

###### Apr 23-27, 2018

###### Apr 30-May 04, 2018
The final week


#### Planning: Azure
The Azure could use to depoly the applcaiton to the "real" existing ethereum test network. However in this stage we will forcusing on finishing the applcaiton frist, after that it will consider to use the Azure for making the application apply to the "real world" and face the public.
