# Logbook

## Logbook for FYP First Semester

### Sep 8-15, 2017
Organised the first meeting with Prof. Lau. I had presented my idea about how to apply blockchain into cloud storage system. In this week I focused on finding example and research of blockchain cloud storages.

### Sep 18-22, 2017
In this week, I reviewed the possibility of using blockchain in voting and commenting system, adjusted the topic and work on the research about blockchain and blockchain applications on reality. I had tried to find out some daily problem could use blockchain as a solution.

### Sep 25-29, 2017
In this week, I created a project on GitHub to save all the progress of the project. In addition to start working on writing the introduction of the blockchain application. I had also created the logbook, read the paper “Cryptographic Counters and Applications to Electronic Voting” (by Jonathan Katz, Steven Myers and Rafail Ostrovsky), try get more information about the electronic voting system in reality. I had contacted Prof. Lau through email and discussed about the architecture of the system.

### Oct 02-06, 2017
In this week I mainly focused on writing the description of the application, added different part namely the requirements, assumptions and expected outcome in the description on GitHub. In addition I kept working on research about different method of information exchange over the untrusted network.

### Oct 09-13, 2017
In this week I focused on writing the proposal, identify the problem of existing voting system. In addition, I started to think about the methodology of blockchain voting system. I had also contacted Prof. Lau through email and reported the progress of my work. Prof. Lau gave some suggestion and I attempted to modify my work.

### Oct 16-20, 2017
I had found different research on the method of blind signatures. I started writing the report on comparing different signatures, mainly focused on RSA, DSA signature, Cryptographic Counters and Mix-nets. In addition, I had created some graphics to illustrate the expected outcome of the system.

### Oct 23-27, 2017
I started testing on different blockchain cloud based system such as the Ethereum Test Network, Azure Blockchain-as-a-Service. The Azure Blockchain could create a blockchain VM for running the service. I focused on creating a VM for testing the Azure solution: Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network.

### Oct 30-Nov 3, 2017
I started to build the application with ionic and react-native. After tried both tools, I decided to use the react- native for building the application frontend.

### Nov 06-10, 2017
In this week, I worked on designing the architecture of the application, studied the blind signature and finish writing the description of blind signature and prepared some graphics to illustrate the concept.

### Nov 13-17, 2017
In this week, I was working on designing the blockchain part of the application. Configuring the blockchain service on the Azure.

### Nov 20-24, 2017
In this week, I was writing the report and finish the result, discussion and the future plan. Finalise the result and keep on making info graphics.

### Nov 27-Dec 01, 2017
Finalise the Final Report, added the reference and completed different sections.
