# Blockchain Commenting/Voting Application

## How it works
Users would use his/her own private key with a public key to verify their identity before posting/commenting. This could keep all information in the blockchain valid. In addition, all the comments cannot be deleted or filtered by 3rd party. Everyone can help to confirm the validity of the contents.

In this example, users could even upload a song into the blockchain system. It could see that blockchain has the ability to contain every votes or every comments in the system.

### Registration
When users finish the registration, they will receive a private key. The application could use the key to verify which one is the vaild user.

### Posting/Commenting
Users need to use their private key and a public key for posting/commenting any information. This action can verify the users' identity and still provide an anonymous commenting system. 

The comment/post would be post to the Blockchain system(e.g. Bitcoin, Ether).

For example, the comment has be hashed and contained into the OP_Return, geth function. It could be successfully saved to the system (forever)

### View/Check Comments
The application would go through the whole blockchain and verify the information.

### Edit
Users or 3rd party could not edit any information when it posted to the blockchain.
